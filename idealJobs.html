    <p>Above is a Table that has been created to display all the team’s ideal jobs as well as the skills and requirements necessary for the specific roles. Reading though the graph and the Specific skills required you can start to see a similarity form even though the jobs are in different fields of IT. Programming and coding is a common task in each role whether it be designing a website or designing and managing code for software, some of the coding languages used include C#, java, C++ etc. Communication and working as a team are key points in any job and as you can see is a requirement in all the ideal jobs listed above, having a strong solid team with great communication skills can be the difference between high quality work and an unfinished task. The IT industry requires the use of Office 365 whether it be typing a word document, using PowerPoint to present to a group of potential clients or providing an excel spreadsheet to your employer it is a requirement in all the fields of IT and a powerful tool. Whatever field in IT you choose you will always run into issues and problems which will require some form of troubleshooting which as you can see is another similarity between each job on the list.  </p>

    <p>Most of the positions and career paths that the team have chosen as an ideal job link with each other in some shape or form whether it be designing and managing web pages or designing, coding and managing software. One of the jobs differentiates a bit compared to the others and that is the role of IT Support Engineer, the job of IT Support Engineer mainly entitles evaluating and diagnosing technical problems and issues but in saying that still crosses paths with the other jobs. All the jobs, even though being different to each other, require some similar training whether it being coding or web development they all cross paths one way or another.  </p>
