        <!-- What? -->

        <h2>What is ToDoTopia?</h2>

        <p>ToDoTopia is a platform that stores your tasks and anything to do with those tasks, such as comments and links to
            Google Drive files. It‚Äôs also a game! ToDoTopia takes care of your to-dos and turns the hard effort you‚Äôve put
            into checking them off into gold, levels, fitness, armour and a village that you build with your team.</p>

        <h2>Who is ToDoTopia Made For?</h2>

        <h3>The Individual.</h3>

        <p>Although ToDoTopia is focused on teams, you as the individual needs to be able to use it outside of work. You
            might use your personal to-do lists for chores, preparing for a vacation or a home renovation project.</p>

        <p>In the game, this means you are keeping fit. When you work on tasks outside of your job, your in-game character‚Äôs
            fitness levels keep you ready for your next battle (which we‚Äôll talk about later).</p>

        <h3>The Team.</h3>

        <p>So, every member of the team ‚Äî or every citizen of your village ‚Äî has a fitness level they need to maintain. But
            what about tasks at work? What about group projects? ToDoTopia can be used for every area of your life. But we
            realised that the way we organise tasks at work should be different from the way we organise our chores at home.
        </p>

        <p>Here is how the app is organised:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>You (your personal lists)</li>
            <li>Team 1 (tasks & projects for Team 1)</li>
            <li>Team 2 (tasks & projects for Team 2)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Here‚Äôs an example of how the application might be organised for an IT student at RMIT:</p>

        <!-- List: class tags 'li.2' etc. are for CSS indenting. -->

        <ul class = "tasks">
            <li>You</li>
                <li class = "li-2">Chores</li>
                    <li class = "li-3">[ ] Make Dinner</li>
                    <li class = "li-3">[ ] Take dog for walk üêï</li>
                <li class = "li-2">Trip to Tasmania</li>
                    <li class = "li-3">[x] Book tickets ‚úà</li>
                    <li class = "li-3">[ ] Plan itinerary</li>
            <li>Team Thirteen</li>
                <li class = "li-2">Assignment 2</li>
                    <li class = "li-3">[ ]Team Profile</li>
                        <li class = "li-4">[x] Copy & paste everyone‚Äôs personal profiles from A1</li>
                        <li class = "li-4">[ ] @James touch it up ‚ú®</li>
                    <li class = "li-3">[ ] IT Jobs</li>
                        <li class = "li-4">[x] List everyone‚Äôs ideal jobs</li>
                        <li class = "li-4">[ ] @Geoffrey make it look good üòé</li>
                    <li class = "li-3">[x] Project Idea</li>
                        <li class = "li-4">[x] Decide on project idea</li>
                        <li class = "li-4">[x] @Jesse outline it in detail üìù</li>
                    <li class = "li-3">[ ] Presentation (website)</li>
                        <li class = "li-4">[x] @James code main layout</li>
                        <li class = "li-4">[ ] Everyone code a page üë®‚Äçüíª</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It might be hard to understand the layout of the application from the above, but what you just saw is the layout
            of an average to-do list app. And although this layout still works really well, we wanted to add some flavour to
            it ‚Äî we wanted to make it more... usable.</p>

        <p>As you enter the list & projects menu, you will see a list of the personal to-do lists you have under a ‚ÄòYou‚Äô
            header (Chores & Trip to Tasmania in the above example). Then, under the ‚ÄòYou‚Äô header you will see the names of
            the teams you are a member of (Team Thirteen in the above example).</p>

        <h3>Tasks in 'You'</h3>

        <p>Every user of ToDoTopia has a You tab. This acts as a place where your personal to-do lists are stored. When you
            complete a task in You, your avatar will gain or maintain fitness. If you haven‚Äôt completed tasks in ‚ÄòYou‚Äô for a
            few days (this means you‚Äôre likely not giving time outside of work to your personal hobbies and projects) you‚Äôre
            likely to lose some fitness. The reason you want this fitness is because of the battles you will have with your
            peers, but we‚Äôll talk about that later on.</p>

        <h3>Tasks in a Team</h3>

        <p>If you are a part of a team (in Uni, work or a project involving another person), then you will see the name of
            the team listed below ‚ÄòYou‚Äô. Clicking into this, you will see the stats of your team mates and the projects
            you‚Äôre all working on.</p>

        <p><b>Team Home</b> or <b>Team Village</b> is a place to hang out... virtually. Basically, as you complete tasks and
            projects as a team you build a village together. There might even be a team chat and call feature here.</p>

        <p>Next to the Team Village you will see the <b>Week Overview</b>. This displays all the tasks coming up this week
            and tasks that have been completed. You will see who is assigned to each task or filter the tasks by only you.
            There will be plenty of ways to view and sort tasks, we‚Äôll touch on that later.</p>

        <p><b>Projects</b> will also be next to the Week Overview. This will be a list of the projects your team is working
            on or has worked on in the past; you may even be able to see upcoming projects. Clicking into each project, you
            will see all the tasks require to complete the project. Tasks can have due dates, when it‚Äôs set for the current
            week, it will be displayed in the Week Overview.</p>

        <p>When projects have progressed, you will see something being built. The more <b>Buildings</b> your village has,
            the more projects your team has completed.</p>

        <p>When you complete a task in a team, you gain <b>Gold</b>. This Gold can be traded for <b>Levels</b>,
            <b>Armour</b> & <b>Weapons</b>. The higher the level, the better Armour & Weapons you can buy. But why would you
            need armour? Well...</p>

        <p><b>Battles</b>! At the end of each week at an agreed time set by the project manager (who plays an important part
            in team projects, we‚Äôll talk about this later), everyone in the team can get their drinks and ToDoTopian avatars
            ready for a Battle. These Battles continue until one ToDoTopian remains or there is a Truce. In a battle, you
            may loose Armour & Levels (not Fitness, however), or you might win Gold or Armour (spoils are divided up between
            the remaining players in a Truce). We have not yet decided on our approach to Battles, since there are so many
            ways to go about it. However we turn out to create it, Battles will be a fun time to chill out at the end of a
            hard week‚Äôs work with your team.</p>

        <p><b>Badges</b> can be earned (golden, sliver, bronze & emerald). When you win a Battle you get a Golden Badge;
            second and third take home a Silver & Bronze Badge respectively. But the ToDoTopian in the team who has
            completed the most work by the end of the week takes home an Emerald Badge (these Emerald badges might translate
            to real world rewards for the employees).</p>

        <p>The <b>Mayor</b> of the Team Village is the employee (or employer) in charge of the team. Only the Mayor can
            create projects. The <b>Construction Manager</b>, or just <b>Manager</b>, has control of the tasks in a project.
            They are the only users who can create tasks in the specific project (all tasks in a project are visible to the
            team). The Manager can be the Mayor, or another member of the team selected by the Mayor.</p>

        <h3>How Tasks are Displayed</h3>

        <p>As mentioned earlier, ToDoTopia displays tasks in a list by default. But views can be changed from Lists to
            Kanban Boards, Calendars, Timelines and People views.</p>

        <p>Every task contains three properties: Date, Progress & Assigned.</p>

        <p><b>Date</b> has a start and an end, or just a due date. Either way, it will be used to display in the Calendar
            and Timeline views.</p>

        <p><b>Progress</b> contains To-Do, In Progress, Under Review & Complete by default, but these can be changed from
            project to project. This property is used for the Kanban Board view, but is also seen on other views as an icon.
        </p>

        <p><b>Assigned</b> is a property that assigns a team member or team members to a task. This is used to organise
            tasks in the People view, but is also displayed as an icon on the task in every other view.</p>

        <p><b>Lists</b> are displayed in, well, a list. Subtasks are viewed in the same view and can be toggled to show or
            hide on a task to task basis. By default, they are all toggled open (meaning, you will see every task).</p>

        <p><b>Kanban Boards</b> are self-explanatory. You drag tasks from one state to progression to another. Any task with
            a progress property will be displayed. If a task hasn‚Äôt had entered a progress status, it will not be displayed
            on the board (unless it is a sub-task and its parent task has a progress status, in this case it will be
            displayed under the parent task on the board and indented a bit).</p>

        <p><b>Calendars</b> are a month at a time and display tasks either with one date on that day, or with a start and
            end date stretching over multiple days. A <b>Timeline</b> works the same but is a continuous line rather than a
            month grid.</p>

        <p>The <b>People</b> view lists all the team members and their assigned tasks. This will be displayed as a gallery,
            and you will click on that team members avatar to view their tasks as a drop down.</p>

        <!-- Why? -->

        <h2>Why Gamification?</h2>

        <p>Why Gamification. Well, that‚Äôs pretty simple... it makes work FUN! Along side this, search the web and you will
            find studies showing the benefits of gamification in the workplace (including increased productivity!).</p>

        <p>We wanted to combine the concept of gamification with already really successful to-do list frameworks. That‚Äôs why
            the use of lists, Kanban boards, timelines, etc are so important to ToDoTopia.</p>

        <!-- How? -->

        <h2>How Will We Make ToDoTopia?</h2>

        <p>We are yet to decide on our exact approach, but this application could be programmed with JavaScript which works
            on Android and iOS and integrates well with web technologies including CSS and HTML. Or we could use Java and
            Swift to make Android and iOS dedicated apps. On the other hand, C# could be used to programme the game side of
            the application (such as the weekly Battles).</p>
